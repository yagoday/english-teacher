# App Flow Document for English Learning Application

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user discovers the app, they are welcomed by a bright and engaging landing page that features colorful visuals and playful characters, such as a friendly panda or the iconic figure inspired by Darth Vader. The landing page explains the purpose of the application in clear, simple language and invites the child or their parent to get started. The first step in the process involves creating an account, which is streamlined through a simple sign-up form. In this application, signing up is primarily accomplished through Google Sign-In, allowing for a swift and secure authentication process. Users are guided through the steps using clear instructions and young-friendly visuals. If a user later needs to sign out or recover a forgotten password, intuitive buttons and prompts are available, ensuring that returning users easily find options to manage their account details and restore access if needed.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, the user is taken directly to the main learning interface, which functions as the home page. This central hub prominently displays a large recording button that invites children to speak English naturally. The main screen is uncluttered and child-friendly, with easy-to-spot navigational elements guiding the user toward the most important features. There are clear visual cues, such as themed icons, that link to profile management and theme customization. The layout is designed to be straightforward, so children can easily understand what action to take next, whether it is to record a voice clip or to explore their progress. This dashboard ensures that the user can quickly move to more detailed sections without confusion.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

In the heart of the application, the main learning interface offers a robust set of features built around speech recognition and real-time AI feedback. When the user presses the recording button, the app immediately activates the Web Speech API to capture and transcribe the child’s spoken English. The transcribed text is displayed on the screen in real time, allowing the user to see their words as they speak. Once the text is shown, the message is directed to a multi-agent system that includes a classification agent, a conversation agent, and a vocabulary agent. The classification agent first determines whether the spoken input is part of a casual conversation, a vocabulary inquest, or a question. Based on this decision, the corresponding agent takes over to provide corrections, explanations, or simple conversation adjustments in an age-appropriate manner. This intelligent routing ensures that the correct type of feedback is provided without interrupting the natural flow of interaction. As a child continues speaking, the system supports a continuous and adaptive conversation, seamlessly transitioning from one feedback loop to another so that every spoken word gets a thoughtful response.

For users who wish to change the appearance or behavior of the application, there is an easy path to reach the theme customization section. Here, the user can choose between themes like the friendly panda or Darth Vader-inspired styles. The change not only updates the visual presentation but also alters the voice characteristics through voice modulation settings to match the chosen character. Navigation between the learning interface and the theme settings is kept simple and child-friendly, often through large, clearly labeled buttons that are hard to miss.

In addition, a dedicated profile management section is part of the user journey. This area allows children to view visual progress indicators, track improvements in vocabulary and pronunciation, and update personal details. Transitions between the profile section and the main learning screen are smooth, with clearly marked navigation elements that guide the user back to the main learning interface without any confusion.

## Settings and Account Management

The settings and account management area is accessible from the main dashboard through a prominent icon or button. In this section, children or their parents can update personal information such as display names and profile pictures, adjust notification settings, and review learning progress. The interface is tailored to be simple enough for young users, with large clickable areas and a friendly tone throughout every prompt. Even though the app uses Google Sign-In for authentication, the account management section also ensures that users feel in control of their profile, making it simple to update any details and return to the main learning interface through a clearly marked back button. For billing or subscription details, even though these are not a core part of this release, any future updates would integrate with this section ensuring that changes to subscription or payment methods could be easily managed from the same space.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In scenarios where users enter invalid data or face connection issues, the application is designed to handle errors gracefully and clearly. If speech recognition fails due to unclear pronunciation or background noise, the user is shown an immediate yet child-friendly message that explains the need to try again. When interacting with the AI agents, if one of the external APIs such as OpenAI or Anthropic Claude is unresponsive or significantly delayed, the app does not freeze but displays a gentle error message that tells the user there is a slight delay. The message reassures the user that the system is working to recover the response. In any instance where a user enters incorrect information in a sign-up or profile update form, clear and simple instructions are provided to rectify the mistake. These error states and alternate paths are all designed to be handled in a way that keeps the overall experience smooth and encourages the child to continue learning even after encountering an issue.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the first moment a child or their parent accesses the application, the journey is designed to be engaging, friendly, and educational. The onboarding process uses simple, colorful wording and playful imagery to not only capture attention but to also simplify account creation via Google Sign-In. Once logged in, the main learning dashboard welcomes the child with a clear call-to-action—a large recording button that makes speech practice the focal point of learning. As the child interacts with the system, every spoken word is transformed into text and processed through intelligent AI agents that provide supportive feedback, guide corrections, and offer vocabulary assistance. Alongside this, seamless transitions allow the user to customize the app’s theme, switching between a friendly panda and a Darth Vader-inspired character, which affects not only the visual design but also voice modulation. The app maintains a supportive network through its account management and settings page, allowing for adjustments and continuous progress tracking. Even in moments of delay or error, gentle messages ensure the overall learning journey remains intact. In summary, the application guides young learners through every stage of improving their spoken English by combining voice recognition, real-time feedback, and supportive interactions, creating a consistently positive and engaging learning environment.
